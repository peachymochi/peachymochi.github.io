                           <p>Today I was really happy that there was no school today (It was Labor Day). I just did some homework, ate some food, and stress about life. I'm really sad that I have school tomorrow, but I can't wait til June so I can finally graduate and leave high school ( ; - ; ) yes. AP Physics is toasting my butt, but it's okay...? I hope it's okay...( ' - ' )</p>
